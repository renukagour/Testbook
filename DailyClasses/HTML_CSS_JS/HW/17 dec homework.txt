        // Scenario: You have a simple HTML button, and you want to display an alert message when a user clicks on it. Provide a code example of how you would use the onclick event to achieve this functionality.
        
        // mouseover Event Scenario:
        
        // Scenario: You have an image of a cat on your website, and you want to change the image source to a playful one when a user hovers their mouse pointer over it. Explain how you can implement this behavior using the mouseover event in JavaScript, and provide a code example.
        
        // mouseout Event Scenario:
        
        // Scenario: You have a navigation menu with several list items, and you want to highlight a list item by changing its background color when a user hovers over it. Additionally, you want to revert the background color to its original state when the user moves the mouse away. How can you achieve this effect using the mouseover and mouseout events? Include both HTML and JavaScript code to demonstrate.
        
        // Combined Event Scenario:
        
        // Scenario: You want to create a button that not only changes its background color when a user clicks on it but also displays a custom message when the user hovers over it. How would you combine the onclick and mouseover events to achieve this functionality? Provide both HTML and JavaScript code for this scenario.
        
        // Event Delegation Scenario:
        
        // Scenario: You have an unordered list (<ul>) with dynamically generated list items (<li>) using JavaScript. You want to handle click events on any of the list items efficiently, even when new items are added dynamically. Explain how you can use event delegation to achieve this and provide a code example.
        
        // mouseenter and mouseleave Event Scenario:
        
        // Scenario: You have a complex HTML element with nested divs and paragraphs, and you want to change the background color of the main div when a user's mouse enters it and revert it to the original color when the user's mouse leaves. Describe how you can use the mouseenter and mouseleave events to handle this scenario, and include code to illustrate your solution.
