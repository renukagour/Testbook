Application of Node.js
 Creating REST APIs -- A REST API is a communication channel between the fronted and backend application
 Creating real time services -- The asynchronous nature of Node enables real-time even-driven programming

MVC- Model View Controller
Model      -- responsible for maintaining data -- actually connected to database -- so anything you do with data
           -- adding or retrieving data is done in the model component --- responds to control request
View       -- data representation is done by view -- generates UI for user -- views are created by data which is 
              collected by the model component but these data aren't taken directly but through the controller, so the view only speaks to the controller 
Controller -- component that enables the interaction between view and model -- doesn't have to worry about handling 
              data  it just tell the model what to do --after receiving data from model it processes it and then it takes all that info and sends it to view and explain how to represent user
