constant time complexity => Big O of 1 => O(1) =>Doesn't depend upon input size throghout same complexity
Ex. Addition of 2 no.s
sum of fist natural no. = n(n+1)/2

linear time complexity => (input size increase = increase in complexity) and vice versa => O(n) => all n power to the 1 like 2n+1 ,n\7 etc.
Ex. => sum of elements in array
O(n/2)~~O(n)
Always straight line graph

Quaadratic time complexity => O(n^2) 
n^3+n^2+n+5 => O(n^3) => always cosider biggest power.
